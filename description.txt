This is a vanilla version of my human space mod. This is pretty much a framework for any such mod where you want the Unted Nations of Earth and the Commonwealth of man to start in the vicinity of each other.  This mod overrides "00_top_countries.txt", "90_syndaw_prescripted_countries.txt" and "prescripted_species_systems.txt" and as such will conflict with any such mods that override those same files (such as many of the graphic modification mods containing true solar system graphics, etc.).  I'm working on my own mod that will edit these files so I will not be able to process any requests for additional mods based on this framework.  However, please feel free to download this and use it as a basis for your own mods.

This mod works as follows:

If you play as the United Nations of Earth there is a weighted possibility that the Commonwealth of Man will spawn in your vicinity.  There is also a lesser possibility that the Deneb system will spawn as an empty system within your vicinity.

If you play as the Commonwealth of Man there is a weighted possibility that the United Nations of Earth will spawn in your vicinity.  There are also two lesser possibilities that Earth will spawn as an early space age empire or that Earth will be a nuclear wasteland.

Playing as the Earth Custodianship generates the same possibilities as playing as the United Nations of Earth.

If you play as a non-human civilization there is a possibility humans will spawn as a primitive civilization or as the United Nations of Earth.

Please report any issues you note and/or please let me know if you like this mod.

Most importantly... enjoy!

Joe
